Some Code Samples to Test Computer Vision for FRC Team 5032's Competition Robot

Various code samples made in Python to test out computer vision. Some are simply direct streams for the driver to see what the robot sees and others convert the stream into edges for identifying objects. There is also a LiDAR testing program that uses a 2D rotating LiDAR sensor to make a floor plan of obstacles and walls around the robot on the field.
